The current state of this packet generator is its current capability to transmit packets at 14 mpps. Of course, this is subject to change as I implement the logic of converting CSV flow level data to actual packets.  
  
As it currently stands, my packet generator spams another node with UDP packets for approximately 10 seconds at 14 mpps.
